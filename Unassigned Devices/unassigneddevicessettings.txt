:ud_settings_case_sensitive_plug:
> Controls whether filenames are case-sensitive.
>
> The default setting of **Auto** allows clients that support case sensitive filenames (Linux CIFSVFS) to tell the Samba server on a per-packet basis that they wish to access the file system in a case-sensitive manner (to support UNIX case sensitive semantics). No Windows system supports case-sensitive filenames so setting this option to auto is the same as setting it to No for them; however, the case of filenames passed by a Windows client will be preserved. This setting can result in reduced performance with very large directories because Samba must do a filename search and match on passed names.
>
> A setting of **Yes** means that files are created with the case that the client passes, and only accessible using this same case. This will speed very large directory access, but some Windows applications may not function properly with this setting. For example, if "MyFile" is created but a Windows app attempts to open "MYFILE" (which is permitted in Windows), it will not be found.
>
> A value of **Forced lower** is special: the case of all incoming client filenames, not just new filenames, will be set to lower-case. In other words, no matter what mixed case name is created on the Windows side, it will be stored and accessed in all lower-case. This ensures all Windows apps will properly find any file regardless of case, but case will not be preserved in folder listings.

:ud_remote_server_test_plug:
> Remote Servers need to have SMB and/or NFS enabled.  This will check that the SMB and/or NFS ports are open.  The 'showmount -e <server>' command on Unraid must also show NFS mounts available.
> For SMB to be considered online, the Remote Server has to have the SMB port open.
> For NFS to be considered online, the Remote Server has to have the NFS port open and the 'showmount -e' command has to show NFS shares.
> There can be a case where the port is open and 'showmount -e' doesn't show NFS shares and NFS will not work.
> If showmount does not return any NFS shares on a reachable remote server like a Synology, it generally means one of the following:
> No NFS Shares Exported:
> The server might not have any directories configured for NFS export. Check the NFS configuration on the Synology device and ensure that folders intended for NFS sharing are explicitly exported.
> Access Restrictions:
> NFS shares may be configured with IP-based access restrictions. Synology devices allow you to specify which IP addresses or networks can access each NFS share. If your IP address is not allowed, the NFS share will not appear in showmount output.
> NFS Service Not Enabled:
> The NFS service on the Synology might not be enabled. Verify this in the Synology DSM settings under Control Panel > File Services > NFS. Enable NFS if it is currently disabled.
> Firewall or Network Configuration:
> The Synology device may have firewall rules blocking the showmount request or the required RPC communication. Ensure that the firewall settings allow traffic on NFS-related ports (typically 2049 for NFS and 111 for RPC).
> Synology Export Options:
> The Synology NFS settings can sometimes require enabling Enable NFS at the top level and specifying Allow NFSv3 if you are using clients that expect NFSv3. Check Control Panel > File Services > NFS to ensure proper configuration.
> By ensuring that NFS is enabled, configured with the correct permissions, and exported directories are allowed for your client IP, showmount should list the available exports.
